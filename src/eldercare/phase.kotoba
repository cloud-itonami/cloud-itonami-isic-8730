  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the residential-eldercare analog of
  `cloud-itonami-isic-6512`'s `casualty.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- resident intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-assess  -- adds jurisdiction assessment + incident
                                 screening writes, still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:resident/intake` (no capital risk yet)
                                 may auto-commit. `:care-plan/finalize`/
                                 `:incident-response/finalize` NEVER
                                 auto-commit, at any phase.

  `:care-plan/finalize`/`:incident-response/finalize` are deliberately
  ABSENT from every phase's `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a
  permanent structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to come.
  Finalizing a real care plan and finalizing a real incident response
  are the two real-world legal acts this actor performs; both are
  always a human facility administrator/care-manager's call.
  `eldercare.governor`'s `:actuation/finalize-care-plan`/`:actuation/
  finalize-incident-response` high-stakes gate enforces the same
  invariant independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this.
  `:incident/screen` is likewise never auto-eligible, at any phase --
  the same posture every sibling's KYC/conflict/independence/
  surveillance/calibration/credential/integrity/patron/authorization/
  safety-test screening op has. Like `credit.phase`/`accounting.
  phase`/`marketadmin.phase`/`testlab.phase`/`clinic.phase`/
  `registrar.phase`/`wagering.phase`/`veterinary.phase`/`funeral.
  phase`/`repairshop.phase`, phase 3's `:auto` set here has only ONE
  member (`:resident/intake`) -- this domain has no separate no-
  capital-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct from the resident record
  itself.")
